💼 **Labour Attendance & Salary Dashboard – A Gift for My Father**

For years, my father has manually tracked the attendance, loans, and salaries of labourers on construction sites — using only pen, paper, and his dedication.
This project is my way of giving back — combining my passion for data with a desire to simplify his life.

❤️ Personal Story
This dashboard isn’t just a data project — it’s a heartfelt solution for a real-life problem my father faced every month.

As his daughter, watching him work so hard inspired me to build something meaningful with the skills I’ve learned.
This is my small way of saying “thank you.”
